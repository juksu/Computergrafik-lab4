This work was created by Andreas Fuchs for Computergraphics lab 4

This code is my own work excluding the used libraries
- TinyXML-2 (www.grinninglizard.com/tinyxml2/index.html )
- OpenGL Mathematics ( http://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.7/index.html )
which can be found in src/lib

To compile this programm simply use the provided Makefile. You may also want to clean before compiling (make clean).
There are no external libraries required so it should compile on any system.
The executable a1106307_lab4 can be found in the bin directory.
The run the programm pass the location of the .xml to the programm as commandline argument, eg: ./a1106307_lab4 example.xml.
The created image will be saved as an ascii ppm image.
